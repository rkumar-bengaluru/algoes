/**
 * A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. 
 * The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive 
 * cars on a road.
 * The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of 
 * cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is 
 * traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.
 * For example, consider array A such that:
 *
 * A[0] = 0
 * A[1] = 1
 * A[2] = 0
 * A[3] = 1
 * A[4] = 1
 * We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).
